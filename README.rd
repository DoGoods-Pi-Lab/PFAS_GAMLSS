These files contain only the GAMLSS models as described in Petroff et al., 2023 https://clinicalepigeneticsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13148-023-01461-5. Code was run in array jobs on the UM-ARC serivces server. 

Part 1 code describes the process for fitting 500 random CpGs on each PFAS, with MSE outputs to select the best model. 
Part 2 describes the GAMLSS models for fitting total DNA methylation data on all the PFAS included. 
Part 3 describes the GAMLSS mdoels for fitting interaction terms between 5-mC and 5-hmc. 
Part 4 describes the GAMLSS models for fitting the 5-mc OR 5-hmc on the sites with interactions from Part 3. 
Part 5 is non reported sex-based analysis.
