This version of R is a base installation only, with no additional
libraries. The gcc/8.2.0 compiler is being automatically loaded. See
module help for more information. The gcc/8.2.0 compiler is required in
order to be able to load additional libraries for your use. If you unload
the gcc module, you will not be able to install new libraries for R.
